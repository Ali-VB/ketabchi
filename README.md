# Ketabchi

Ketabchi is a platform designed to connect travelers and individuals who can carry items for them. It facilitates a system where users can post requests for items to be brought from specific locations, and travelers can offer to carry those items as they embark on their journeys. This platform aims to create a mutually beneficial relationship, allowing travelers to potentially earn something for their efforts and individuals to receive items they need from abroad.

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
